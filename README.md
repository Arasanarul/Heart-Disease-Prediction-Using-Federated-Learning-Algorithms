# Heart Disease Prediction Using Federated Learning Algorithms

This repository presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting heart disease using federated learning algorithms. Federated learning enables collaborative model training across multiple decentralized devices or servers while maintaining data privacy. This approach is particularly beneficial in healthcare, where patient data confidentiality is paramount.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on developing a predictive model for heart disease using federated learning techniques. By leveraging data from multiple sources without centralizing it, the model can learn from diverse datasets, enhancing its generalization capabilities while preserving data privacy.

## Key Features

- **Federated Learning Implementation**: Utilizes federated learning algorithms to train models across multiple decentralized datasets.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Employs machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics.
- **Data Privacy Preservation**: Ensures that sensitive health data remains on local devices, with only model updates being shared.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the algorithms.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training machine learning models.
- **PySyft**: A library for encrypted, privacy-preserving machine learning, facilitating federated learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides tools for data mining and data analysis.
